<P>
Welcome to the CHORD User Guide!

CHORD is a share-ware utility that was first created by lazy guitarists who got tired
of turning pages in the middle of the songs they liked.
<P>
CHORD takes a file containing the lyrics and chords of a song and produces a formatted
version of that song. The song has now the following attributes:
<UL>
<LI>Titles and sub-titles have been centered;
<LI>The lyrics appear in the font and size of your choice;
<LI>All chords name appear right above the right lyrics;
<LI>All chords used in your song appear as grids at the bottom of the page.
</UL>

CHORD also provides support for 
<UL>
<LI>Multiple columns on a page
<LI>Index of a songbook
<!-- <LI>Multiple logical pages per physical pages ( 1, 2 or 4) -->
<LI>Configurable fonts for the lyrics and the chord names
<LI>Multiple songs inside one file
<LI>The complete ISO 8859-1 character set and
<LI>Chorus marking
</UL>
You have a great many options on the final appearance of you songs. All of them are
described in the section titled "Options"
<P>
For now, please read on to better understand what CHORD can do for you.
<P>
<H2>An Example</H2>
This is an example of a "source" file for CHORD, i.e. a file that is meant to be processed by CHORD.
<PRE>
{title:Love me tender}
{subtitle:Presley/Matson}
[G]Love me tender [A7]love me sweet [D7]Never let me [G]go
[G]You have made my [A7]life complete [D7]and I love you [G]so
{start_of_chorus}
[G]Love me [B7]tender [Em]love me [G7]true
[C]all my [Cm]dreams ful[G]fill
[G]For [Dm6]my [E+]dar[E7]ling [A7]I love you
[D7]and I always [G]will [Am7] [D7]
{end_of_chorus}
[G]Love me tender [A7]love me long [D7]Take me to your [G]heart
[G]For it's there that [A7]I belong [D7]and we'll never [G]part
{comment:Chorus}
[G]Love me tender [A7]Love me dear [D7]Tell me you are [G]mine
[G]I'll be yours through [A7]all the years [D7]till the end of
[G]time
{comment:Chorus}
</PRE>
Here are the important points about that file:
<UL>
<LI>It can be created using any text editor you like;
<LI>All characters present in the ISO 8859-1 character set can be used.
</UL>
We will explain the content of that file. But first, let's look at the end result,
<A href=lovemetender.html>here</A>.<P>

<H2>How do I use CHORD ?</H2>
Using CHORD is simple. four step are required:
<OL>
<LI>Type in the lyrics of the songs: this can be done with any text editor, or
in the chord editor itself. 
<LI>Insert the chord names between square brackets throughout the lyrics. The chord
name will appear right above the letter that follows the closing bracket
Love me tender [A7]love me sweet [D7]Never let me [G]go
<LI>Insert any directive you want to give to CHORD: titles, sub-titles, chorus markers, 
comments, etc.
{title:Love me tender}
{subtitle:Presley/Matson}
<LI>Have  CHORD process your file. This will format or "render" your song. You can print this 
 directly on any printer your computer knows about.
 
 
<H2>Directives</H2>
A directive is a string of text that appears between french brackets ('{' and '}') and
has a special meaning to CHORD. It contains a message that will affect the way CHORD
 processes your file. Examples of directive uses would be: changing the
fonts, marking a chorus, and defining a title.
<P>
Directives must be alone on a line. Blanks before the opening bracket and after the
closing bracket are not significant. Blanks inside a directive are ignored.
<P>
Supported directives are:
<UL>

<LI><B>chordfont: postscript_font</B> Sets the name of the font used to display chord names..

<LI><B>chordsize: n</B> Sets the size of the font used to display chord names.

<LI><B>columns:n</B> or <B>col: n</B> Specifies the number of columns on the pages 
of  the current song.

<LI><B>column_break</B> or <B>colb</B> Forces a column break. The next  line  of  
the  song will  appear  in  the
next available column, at the same height as the last "columns" state-
ment if still on  the  same page, or at the top of the page otherwise.

<LI><B>comment: or c:</B> Will call the printing of the rest of the line, highlighted 
by a grey box.
(Useful to call a chorus, for example)

<LI><B>comment_italic:</B> or <B>ci:</B>
Will print the comment in an italic font... well not really, it will print
the comment in the font used for printing the chord names (which is
normally italic unless you specified a different chord_font).

<LI><B>comment_box:</B> or <B>cb:</B>Will print the comment inside a bounding box.

<LI><B>define: name base-fret offset frets str1...str6</B>
Defines a new chord called "name". The keyword "base-fret" indicates
that the number that follows ("offset") is the first fret that is to be displayed 
when representing the way this chord is played.
The keyword "frets" then appears and is followed by 6 values. These
values are the fret number [ 1 to n ] for each string [str1 to str6] and are
RELATIVE to the offset. A value of "-", "X" or "x" indicates a string
that is not played.
Keywords base-fret and frets are mandatory.
A value of 0 for a given string means it is to be played open, and will
be marked by a small open circle above the string in the grid. The
strings are numbered in ascending order of tonality, starting on the low
E (the top string). On output, a chord defined in the user's .chordrc file
will have a small asterisk near its grid, a chord defined in a song will
have two small asterix. At the beginning of every song, the default
chords are reloaded and the user's .chordrc file is reread. Chord definition of new 
chords inside the text of a song are only valid for that song.
The syntax of a {define} directive has been modified in CHORD 3.5.
CHORD will attempt to recognize an old-format {define} and will
accept it. It will, though, print a warning inviting you to modify your
input file to use the new syntax (the exact {define} entry to use is provided as an example).

<LI><B>end_of_chorus</B>  or <B>eoc</B>
Marks the end of the chorus.

<LI><B>end_of_tab</B> or <B>eot</B> Will stop using monospace font. The effect is 
implicit at the end of a
song.

<LI><B>new_page</B> or <B>np</B> Will force a logical page break (which will obviously 
turn out to be a
physical page break if you are not in either 2-up or 4-up mode).

<LI><B>new_physical_page</B> or <B>npp</B> Will force a physical page break (in any mode).

<LI><B>no_grid</B> or <B>ng</B> Will disable printing of the chord grids for the current song.
grid or g Will enable the printing of the chord grids for the current song (subject
to the limitation caused by the usage of the -g option). This directive
will override the runtime -G option for the current song.

<LI><B>signature</B> or <B>sig</B> A string of text to appears at the top right corner of every
rendered page. If an absolute path name, is assumed to be to name of a GIF or JPEG image to be use
for the same purpose. Default to a "Outout by Chord 4.0" image.

<LI><B>start_of_chorus</B> or <B>soc</B>
Which indicates the start of a chorus (yep). The complete chorus will
be highlighted by a change bar, to be easily located by the player.

<LI><B>start_of_tab</B> or <B>sot</B> Will cause chord to use a monospace 
(i.e.: non-proportional) font for
the printing of text. This can be used to enter 'tab' information where
character positioning is crucial. The Courier font is used with the same
point-size as the rest of the text.

<LI><B>subtitle:</B> or <B>st:</B> Specifies a string to be printed right below the 
title. Many subtitles can
be specified.

<LI><B>textfont: postscript_font</B> Sets the name of the font used to display text.

<LI><B>textsize: n</B> Sets the size of the font used to display text.

<LI><B>title:</B> or <B>t:</B> Specifies the title of the song. It will appear centered 
at the top of the
first page, and at the bottom of every other page, accompanied there by
the page number, within the current song.

</UL>
<H2>Chord names</H2>
All chordnames must be build in the following way in order to be recognized: 
 {note-name}[#|b][^/]* [ '/' {note-name}[#|b][^/]* ]
 That is, a valid note name, possibly followed by '#' or 'b', followed
by other modifier ('7', 'm', etc...). Many such construct can make up a
chord name, as long as they are separated by '/'.
<BR>
 {note-name} must appear in the list 'A','B','C','D','E','F','G'.
<H2>Another example</H2>
<P>
This example uses some of the more advanced directives:
<PRE>

See the result 
<A href=everybodyhurts.html>here</A>.<P>
. Look for the tablatures and the modified definitions
of chords G, D4 and E.
<P>
<H2>About the chords CHORD knows about</H2>
CHORD knows of about 360 chords. Now, we KNOW your favorite chord won't be
in there, and if it is, it will be all wrong. So we put in a facility for people to define
their own chords. This facility will also let you redefine already defined chords. For
the details, look in the "Directives" section of this guide, for the "define" directive.
<P>
<H2>About your preferences</H2>
You can store your preferences about fonts and chords in a file that is unique to
every user. This file can be specified in many ways: 
<P> First we look for a runtime value for the "CHORDRC" system property. This is something you might have added to the argument 
of the Java runtime invocation, using a "-DCHORDRC=somefile" construction.The we look in the users's
home direcetory for a file called "chordrc". Then we look for a file called "chordrc" in the directory
from which the application was launched. We read only one file. 
<P>For the list of the preferences you can have, see the "Directives" section.
<P>
<H2>Putting comments in your files</H2>
A line starting with a '#' is interpreted as a comment, and generates no output.
(although all your comments are automatically mailed to the authors, and we read
them at parties...)
<H2>Where to find CHORD files</H2>
CHORD having been around since 1991 there is a number of CHORD  input files
freely available if you have access to the Internet.
http://www.nada.kth.se/~f91-jsc is the home page of a CHORD archive.
 FTP.NEVADA.EDU (131.216.1.11) contains chord and tab files for a great many pop 
 and traditional songs. Many of the
songs are in CHORD  format. Look for file with the extensions CRD, .CHO, 
.CRDPRO, .CHOPRO or .CHORDPRO. The songs are in the 
directory /pub/guitar. This site is available for anonymous FTP.
The following USENET newsgroup are often used to post or request chord and tab
files: rec.music.makers.guitar.tablature, alt.guitar.tab

<H2>How do I install CHORD on my machine?</H2>
Chord requires the Java runtime (JRE) to be present on your machine. The minimum version
required to tun Chord is 1.2.2. You can download this from Javasoft 
<A HREF="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.2/jre/index.html">here.<A>
<P>
Once installed, all you need to invoke is "javaw -jar <full_path_to_chord4.jar>. You can
easily create a shortcut on your Windows(tm) desktop that point to 
"c:\windows\system\javaw.exe -jar <full_path_to_chord4.jar>". Under Unix, the same 
desktop setup is platform specific (CDE, OpenWindows, Linux...), but the launch command is the same.

<H2>The Chord Editor</H2>
The Editor is a simple text editor that supports drag and drop. Dragging a single file opens that
file in the editor. Dragging in a directory or many files or directories brings the list
of names in the editor.
<P>
That is because the process of rendering your documents can be done by processing the content
of the editor as "Chord input" or as a list of Chord files. See The editor menus below.

<LI>Disable printing of the chord grids for the whole input file(s). The effect can be disable 
for any particular song by the usage of the <B>grid</B> or <B>g</B> directive.
<LI>Sets the paper size. Recognizes "us" and "a4".
<LI>Places the odd and even page numbers in the lower right and left corners respectively 
(for two-sided output). The default is all page num-
bers on the right.
<LI>Disable printing of grids for "easy" chords. Whether a built-in chord is easy or not 
has been arbitrarily decided by the authors. The general rule was that any chord in its major
, minor, 7th or minor 7th was "easy" while everything else (maj7, aug, dim,sus, etc...) was "tough". 
All chords defined in the $HOME/.chordrc file
or in the input file are defined as "tough".
<LI>Generates a table of contents with the song titles and page numbers. It implies page 
numbering through the document. Index pages are not numbered.

<LI>Places the odd page numbers on the left.
<LI>Prints only the lyrics of the song.
<LI>Numbers the pages consecutively starting with first_page (e.g. 1).
Without this option, each song restarts the page numbering at 1, and
page numbers are only put on subsequent pages of multiple page
songs.
<LI>Prints two logical pages per physical page.
<LI>Prints four logical pages per physical page.
<LI>Sets up transposition to that number of halftones. Can not be zero.
