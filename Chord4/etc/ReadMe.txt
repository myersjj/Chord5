This is a description of a utility called CHORD developed by
Martin Leclerc and  Mario Dorion 
 

CHOR will read an ascii file containing songs lyrics as well as directives
that describes the chords and tablature needed to play a song on the guitar
plus formatting information. CHORD will then generate a professional
looking sheet-music version of your input file on your printer.

CHORD reads a text file
containing the lyrics of a song, the chords to be played, their
description and some other optional data to produce a printed
document that includes:

o A text editor with song editing functions
o Centered titles
o Chord names above the word
o Graphical representation of the chords at the end of the songs
o Multiple columns on a page
o Index of a songbook
o Configurable fonts for the lyrics and the chord names
o Multiple songs inside one file
o The complete ISO 8859-1 character set
o Chorus marking
o Drag and drop of files or directories into the editor
